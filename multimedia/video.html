<h1>One minute review: The Godfather</h1>

<p>Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 film The Godfather, based on the Mario Puzo novel of the same name, might be one of the most influential films of the 20th century. It might not be Citizen Kane, but much like Star Wars it's a story everyone knows about at least through cultural osmosis. Real world mafia figures have modelled themselves after The Godfather, the very term "godfather" only started being used in relation to organised crime after the film's release, and several pieces of the American lexicon are references to the movie or its sequels. Of the three films, Sidney Lumet once said, "They are as close to perfect movies as I think exists," and whether one agrees or not, one owes it to themselves to at least see what the hype is about. As much as it's infamous for codifying our idea of the Mafia, and arguably contributes to negative stereotypes of Italian-Americans, the Godfather and the sequels are movies about the American dream and the immigrant experience as well, and past the grim mobsters doing mobster things these are stories of considerable psychological depth. If they were "just" mob movies, they wouldn't have stood the test of time.</p>
