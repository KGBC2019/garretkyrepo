<h2>My Background</h2>

<p>I don't have any real professional background in IT prior to starting at Boston College. However, I have taken several classes on the subject by now, and last semester I took an introductory coding class dealing with Javascript and HTML in which I was tasked with constructing web pages. These weren't so much full on web development tasks as they were getting the basic skeleton up and getting the coding right, at least up until the final. I must admit I did horribly on that final. I've taken various classes on web security and the inner workings of the internet. None of them were as focussed specifically on the internet as it seems this one is, though, being more about security issues and how people use it. </p>

<h2>My Interest in Web Development</h2>

<p>I'm not sure I have any plans for future web development work at all, to be honest. My plans are to go to the school's cybersecurity grad program and try to break into that business; this is just a required course. However, it couldn't hurt to know, and web development seems like an important, in-demand skill.</p>

<h2>My Extra-Curricular  Interests, Sports or Hobbies</h2>

<p>I have lots of hobbies, things which I'm not sure I want to go into full detail on. I've boxed, wrestled, done judo, enjoy sports like weightlifting, have in general been meaning to get much more physically active than I currently am, so on and so forth. </p>

<h2>What I hope to Gain from this Course</h2>

<p>While I obviously want the 4 credits, I am hoping to gain skills, experience and connections in this course that will be useful in my future career path, as well as an improvement in my GPA which will make it more likely that I get into my chosen programme. Sorry, I don't have a whole lot to say about it.</p>

<h2>Topics or Ideas I Would Like to Discuss and Learn About</h2>

<p>How to use this knowledge to get rich. Iâ€™m in this major for the money, nothing else.</p>
