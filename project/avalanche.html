	<div class="entry-content">
	The radio was dead and half the shack lost to snow and I could feel I had another day of air in here. Another day if I breathed slow and quiet.<br><br>
Another day if I spoke and moved as little as a man could. <br><br>
Another day if the roof continued to hold. <br><br>
Another day if the barricades stood tall and held out the cold and kept the product of the avalanche from crashing through and drowning everything in white. <br><br>
Another day if whatever slid through the snow and the ice like a knife through ribs chose not to come crashing through. The window was pitch black a moment before. Spider cracks from the sheer pressure of so much snow dancing up and down its edge. Now I heard the shift and rumble of hundreds of pounds being displaced and fingers of sunlight poked through. An undulating shadow danced through it and vanished and I wondered if it might see my breath misting the air in front of my nose. <br><br>
Nothing else moved. No sound and no air. Wind singing down the long trailing tunnels dug by the thing outside. Walls of snow heavy enough and thick enough to crush a man to death crumbling and falling into place. The chatter of my own teeth and war drum of my own heart. What remained of the shack reeked of stagnation and cloth and rags piled on one after another and another to stave off as much cold as they could. <br><br>
To think about that was to die. To accept never seeing sunlight again. To never going back home. <br><br>
How many days had it been? I looked to my phone and found only blackness staring up at me. My own reflection in the abyss. The avalanche had smothered its signal to death and the battery had only had so much life to it. <br><br>
So much for the torch. So much for reading material. <br><br><br>

I had learnt to keep busy to prevent my mind from devouring itself. Pressups and squats until every muscle threatened to fall off. Songs helped. So did telling myself stories. Watching the light grow and recede and letting my eyes adjust to the darkness. Rationing out what food and water remained. I named the creature that circled the shack and forgot it and named it again and forgot it again. I think the last candidate was Jormy after Jormungand the serpent that circled the world but that felt too friendly and I couldn’t exactly ask its opinion. I kept the space clean when I could see enough to organise anything. <br><br>
Cleanliness was next to Godliness and if things kept going how they were I would need all the help I could get. A sweep of the floor and if the roof or the barricade were especially creaky that day I would find something to stand on and push things into place for lack of tools. Push and push as if the strength of man mattered one whit next to that of nature. <br><br>
 Today with the teasing glimpses of sunlight clearing some of the gloom I sat before the microphone on the off chance any ears waited. Outside the howling of wind and the crack-rustle of muscle and sinew powering through the storm. Supposedly help was to come but how long? <br><br>
“Hi. I’d like to place an order.” Silence but the crackling suggested a signal. It was made for this kind of problem. Not made to rely on satellites that could be blocked off. “Still alive here, so I’d really like to take you guys up on the whole ‘not dying under a hundred tonnes of snow’ offer, uh, if you don’t mind.” <br><br>
Silence. The hiss-squeal of static and his call such as it was stretching on and on through the airwaves. Uniting men who a hundred years before never would have heard each other’s voice and never could have helped. <br><br>
From the first days we had come down from the trees men had used wits and technology and connections to overcome a world set against them. A world where their mightiest individual efforts might as well be a gnat. Where the slitherer outside could make a lunch out of any one person in an instant. <br><br>
Some appendage visible only in my imagination smacked against the wall and buckled wood but failed to break it. As if to remind me it was there and that I was nothing. White seeped through brown like blood from a wound. <br><br>
The roof creaked and shuddered. Wind wouldn’t accomplish much with so much snow in the way but sheer weight would do the job. <br><br>
Help was supposed to come before I had to worry about that. <br><br>
“We’ve started taking bets in here.” Keep talking so I don’t end up howling like a madman. So they don’t find me disappeared one day with the only record of my existence being my death screams echoing through history like that poor fool who thought he could live with grizzlies. “What’s going to get me first? The avalanche finally deciding to crush me to death or uh, whatever the hell the thing outside the cabin is? I think it’s some bastard mix of a fish and a snake but hell if I’ve ever actually seen it. Don’t, you know, want to? Can’t blame me, right?” <br><br>
It probably had teeth. It probably hungered. Why stay so long otherwise? <br><br>
More battering at the walls like a kitten idly swatting at a cornered mouse. More tormented squeals from the beams in the ceiling forced to do the work of ten Atlases. My own echo slapping me in the face. <br><br>
I had always hated my own voice until it was the only company I had. Now I loathed it like only the most intimate partners can loathe each other. White hot contempt in every syllable and every breath and every voiceless glance. In the hollow contemptuous silence even the shifting and circling stopped and there were the faintest reverberations reaching out from what felt like leagues away. Nonsense. <br><br>
How could anything reach through snowfall so deep and so thorough it swallowed up an entire house? <br><br>
“Hello?” A voice so sudden it rang through the ruins like a gunshot and sent me back in my chair so it raised onto its back legs. “Hello? Are you still there?” <br><br>
“Yes! I’m here! I’m here!” Too long since I last drank. My voice cracked and bled and strained and a mix of dust and snow fell above my head. “I think I’ve been here for days!” <br><br>
“You think?” <br><br>
“Guesswork’s the best I’ve got. You lose track.” <br><br>
“I’m sure.” More surprise than sarcasm. Someone on the back foot trying to recover. “Sir, just slow down for a minute. We have people on the way.” <br><br>
“You’ve had people on the way since I got here!” <br><br>
“That’s why you need to slow down. I’m amazed you’re even alive to be frank.” <br><br>
“Thanks?” I was too but you didn’t say such things. “How much longer will it be?” <br><br>
“It’s hard to say. We don’t want to rush it and make things worse but we have people in the area. How are you for supplies?” <br><br>
The rustling and crashing and groaning again. Louder. Enough to obscure words and meanings. Something smacked into the side of the shack once more for good measure. More snow wafted in like ocean spray ahead of the wave. <br><br>
“A couple days, tops. You’d better hurry or there’s not gonna be anything left to rescue, between that and whatever’s outside.” <br><br>
“Outside?” Concern. Something about it stoked a little fire in my gut but I pressed on. <br><br>
“Yeah, uh, there’s this huge thing-“<br><br>
“A huge thing.” <br><br>
“-Let me talk, damn it! I don’t know what it is, not exactly. It lives in the snow I think, big enough it’s swimming through and clearing out huge chunks where it goes. Nothing like anything I know exists.” <br><br>
“You can’t describe it at all?” An edge of scepticism that had me biting my tongue. You’ve-cracked-haven’t-you the unspoken question. <br><br>
“I can’t see well enough to describe my own left hand right now.” <br><br>
“I see.” Silence. Shifting snow. Groaning wood. The room growing warmer and warmer while I drank in conversation like I found an oasis in the desert. “It’s good that you’ve been talking so much, we have a team close by, they’ve been following the signal – they haven’t reported anything like you’ve described, but you should be hearing from them any minute now.” <br><br>
Relief. Weight off the shoulders. I shrugged off two coats with a mighty sigh and wavered under the battering ram stench of my own sweat. <br><br>
“Please, the sooner the better. If I never see snow again” <br><br>
A groaning rumbling roar like all the anger of the Earth condensed and unleashed in one mighty explosion. A shattering of timbers and rushing of snow packed tight enough to be denser than brick. White. <br><br>
White. <br><br>
White everywhere. <br><br>
White devouring the world. <br><br>
Voices. Far off. Panic. <br><br>
Cold. <br><br>
So very cold. <br><br>
